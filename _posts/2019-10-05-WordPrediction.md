###  This post follows the John Hopkins University Capstone Project which required the application of knowledge gained from 9 other courses by the specialization [JHU Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).


### Below is a demo image from the app

Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. SwiftKey builds a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on their mobile devices. One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is predictive text models. When someone types:

I went to the

the keyboard presents three options for what the next word might be. For example, the three words might be gym, store, restaurant. In this capstone Project A Katz's back off Ngram model was created to predict next word in a sentence entered by a user in an application which is hosten on Shinyapps.io
